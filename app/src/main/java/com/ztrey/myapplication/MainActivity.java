      Youtube tutorial:
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fV9NmvxXJo - russian guy
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9XdV77NE_M - code i'm gonna use
        stored gitlab code in ReminderApp
      Android documentation here:
      https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications

      Todo eventually
       . figure if the setRepeating method is really the best way to set a recurring notification (likely testing?)
       . figure out if i'm gonna store my quotes in a SQL database
       . review the icons and text used in the notifications
       . give all of the aesthetics a look over
       .. perhaps a different app icon?
